# FlareWeather Backend - Ready for Railway Deployment

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Options:

### Option 1: Railway Web Interface (Easiest)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Connect your repository
5. Railway auto-detects Python and deploys
6. Set environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Option 2: Railway CLI (If you can install it)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI first
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Then deploy
cd flareweather-backend
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
1. Zip the `flareweather-backend` folder
2. Upload to Railway web interface
3. Set environment variables

## 📁 Files Ready:
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- ✅ `Procfile` - Process configuration  
- ✅ `main.py` - FastAPI application
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Railway config

## 🔧 After Deployment:
1. Get your deployment URL (e.g., `https://flareweather-backend.railway.app`)
2. Update iOS app's `AIInsightsService.swift`:
   ```swift
   private let baseURL = "https://your-app-name.railway.app"
   ```
3. Test the deployed API

## 🎯 Expected Result:
Your FlareWeather backend will be live at a public URL that your iOS app can access from anywhere!
