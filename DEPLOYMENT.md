## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

Set these in your hosting platform:

### Required:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for AI insights

### Optional:
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed origins
- `DEBUG`: Set to `false` in production
- `PORT`: Server port (usually set by platform)

## ðŸ“± iOS App Configuration

After deployment, update your iOS app's `AIInsightsService.swift`:

```swift
// Replace localhost with your deployed URL
private let baseURL = "https://your-app-name.railway.app"
// or
private let baseURL = "https://your-app-name.fly.dev"
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Deployment

Test your deployed API:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health

# Test analyze endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symptoms": [{"id": "test", "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", "symptom_type": "Headache", "severity": 5, "notes": "Test"}],
    "weather": [{"timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", "temperature": 20.0, "humidity": 60.0, "pressure": 1013.0, "wind": 10.0}],

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

1. **Railway**: Easier setup, good for testing
2. **Fly.io**: Better performance, more configuration options
3. **Environment Variables**: Always set your OpenAI API key
4. **CORS**: Configure allowed origins for security
5. **Monitoring**: Both platforms offer logs and monitoring

Choose Railway for simplicity or Fly.io for better performance!
