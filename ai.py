CONTEXT:
- Location: {location_str}
- Weather mood: {weather_descriptor}.
- Hourly cue: {hourly_note}
- Diagnoses in mind: {diagnoses_str}{sensitivities_context}
- Comfort tips you may use exactly (VARY your selection - don't repeat the same tips): {comfort_clause}
- Optional research notes: {papers_text}

CRITICAL COMFORT TIP RULES:
- You MUST vary comfort tip selections - NEVER repeat the same tip
- NEVER use "Move at a pace that feels kind to you" or similar phrases repeatedly
- Rotate through ALL 30 available tips - don't favor any single one
- Match the tip to the specific weather conditions (e.g., use warmth tips for cold, hydration for humidity shifts)
- If you've used a tip recently, choose a different one
- The user has seen repetitive tips - prioritize variety over familiarity

MANDATORY STYLE:
- Plain, everyday language only - use grade 12 reading level vocabulary.
- Never use made-up words, technical jargon, or obscure terms.
- Never use numbers, units, or percentages.
- Never reference technical meteorology (no hPa, dewpoint, fronts, etc.).
- Never give medical advice or instructions.
- Never promise outcomes; use gentle "may" framing.
- Allowed feeling words: reactive, easier, gentle, steady, calmer.
- Keep sentences short and calm.
- Even if context shows numbers, do NOT include them in your output.
- You MUST naturally mention the user's conditions or sensitivities when relevant (e.g., "For those with arthritis, this humidity shift may feel noticeable" or "If pressure changes are a trigger for you, today's drop may be worth planning around"). Keep it conversational and non-medical. If the user has specific diagnoses or sensitivities, reference them in the insight.

OUTPUT VALID JSON EXACTLY:

  "why": "Brief sentence on why bodies may notice today.",

CRITICAL: If the user has specific conditions or sensitivities listed above, you MUST reference them in this sentence. EXAMPLES: If user has arthritis: 'Today brings cool air with a heavy blanket of humidity which could increase joint stiffness, especially for those with arthritis.' If user has migraines: 'Dropping pressure today which could trigger headaches if you're sensitive to pressure changes.'

Use grade 12 reading level vocabulary - no made-up words or technical jargon. EXAMPLES: If user has arthritis: 'For those with arthritis, dropping pressure can cause tissues to expand slightly, increasing pressure on sensitive joints.' If user has migraines: 'If you experience migraines, rapid pressure drops can trigger headaches by affecting blood vessel dilation.' If user has pressure sensitivity: 'Since pressure shifts are a trigger for you, this drop may be particularly noticeable in your joints and breathing.'

Be specific when possible (e.g., 'Chinese medicine suggests a 5-minute tai-chi routine' for muscle tension, 'Western medicine recommends gentle stretching' for joint stiffness). Match the tip to today's specific weather conditions and symptoms mentioned in the insight. Use tentative language (may, might, can help) - NEVER use definitive statements like 'will work' or 'guaranteed'. If risk is MODERATE or HIGH, always include a tip. If risk is LOW, you may leave empty. Examples: 'Chinese medicine suggests a 5-minute tai-chi routine to ease muscle tension', 'Western medicine recommends gentle stretching; Ayurveda suggests warm oil massage', 'For joint stiffness, Western medicine suggests movement; Chinese medicine recommends acupressure points'.

User context: {diagnoses_str}{location_note}.{sensitivities_context}

CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULES:
- Use grade 12 reading level vocabulary only - no made-up words, technical jargon, or obscure terms.
- If you're unsure if a word is too complex, use a simpler alternative.
- Never use words that don't exist in standard dictionaries.
- Use plain, everyday language that anyone can understand.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST mention the user's specific conditions or sensitivities in the daily blurbs when the weather matches their triggers. Do NOT give generic descriptions. Personalize each day's descriptor to their situation. EXAMPLES: If user has arthritis and humidity is high: "Moderate risk — high humidity may increase joint stiffness for those with arthritis" or "High risk — damp conditions could be challenging for arthritis." If user has migraines and pressure is dropping: "Moderate risk — pressure drop may trigger headaches if you experience migraines" or "High risk — rapid pressure shift could activate migraine sensitivity." If user has pressure sensitivity: "Moderate risk — pressure shift may be noticeable if pressure changes affect you." If user has multiple conditions, mention the most relevant one for that day's weather. Keep it conversational and non-medical - reference their triggers naturally.

{prompt_context}{today_context}

Use the weekday order exactly as provided: {weekday_clause}.

RISK LEVEL DETERMINATION (USE THE SUGGESTED RISK LEVELS PROVIDED):
The suggested risk levels are calculated based on:
- Pressure changes (affects all conditions, especially migraines)
- Temperature swings (affects arthritis, fibromyalgia)
- Humidity swings (affects arthritis, fibromyalgia)
- Storm fronts (rapid pressure drop + wind + humidity - especially triggers migraines)
- Extreme humidity levels (very high/low)
- Cold + damp conditions (arthritis trigger)
- Multiple simultaneous weather shifts (compound effect)

RISK LEVELS:
- LOW RISK: Stable conditions, minimal changes across all factors
- MODERATE RISK: Noticeable changes in one or more factors, or moderate changes in multiple factors
- HIGH RISK: Rapid/large changes, storm fronts, or multiple significant shifts happening together

CRITICAL: Each day's weather data includes a [SUGGESTED RISK: X - Factors: ...] hint calculated from actual weather data AND your specific conditions ({diagnoses_str}). 

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: You MUST use the exact risk level from the [SUGGESTED RISK] hint. DO NOT override it or default to Low.
- If the hint says "High", you MUST use "High risk" for that day - NO EXCEPTIONS
- If the hint says "Moderate", you MUST use "Moderate risk" for that day - NO EXCEPTIONS  
- Only use "Low risk" if the hint explicitly says "Low"

VALIDATION: Before returning your response, verify that you used the exact risk levels from the [SUGGESTED RISK] hints. If you see "Moderate" or "High" in the hints, those days MUST show "Moderate risk" or "High risk" in your output, NOT "Low risk".

DO NOT default to Low risk for all days. The risk calculation considers your specific sensitivities ({diagnoses_str}) and all weather factors, not just pressure. The suggested risks are calculated from real weather data - trust them and use them exactly as provided.

CRITICAL: You are generating daily descriptors for weekly insights. Each day must have a risk level (Low, Moderate, or High) and a short descriptor following STRICT rules.

STRUCTURE: Weekday — Risk Level — descriptor (3-6 words after risk label)

STRICT RULES:
1. KEEP IT SHORT: 3-6 words after the risk label
2. NO MEDICAL CLAIMS: No "reduce," "treat," "prevent," "cause," "trigger," "flare," "symptom spikes"
3. WELLNESS-SAFE wording ONLY - use approved phrases below
4. NO VAGUE PHRASES: ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - "a bit more", "a bit", "bit more", "more", "a bit easier", "a bit achy", "bit achy", "may feel different," "supportive," "gentle shift," "things may feel off", "more stable", "at ease", "more balanced", "steady conditions", "gentle conditions", "balanced conditions"
5. NO WEATHER NUMBERS: No pressure values, temps, humidity %, wind speeds
6. EACH DAY MUST BE UNIQUE - even if all days are "Low," descriptors MUST vary
7. LANGUAGE LEVEL: Use grade 12 reading level vocabulary only - no made-up words, technical jargon, or obscure terms. Never use words that don't exist in standard dictionaries.
8. MENTION CONDITIONS/SENSITIVITIES: If the user has specific conditions (e.g., arthritis, migraines, fibromyalgia) or sensitivities (e.g., pressure shifts, humidity changes), reference them naturally in the descriptors when relevant (e.g., "pressure-sensitive day" or "arthritis-aware shift")
9. VALIDATION: Before returning your response, check EVERY descriptor. If ANY descriptor contains "a bit", "bit more", "more", "a bit easier", "a bit achy", or any other vague phrase not in the approved lists, you MUST replace it with an approved descriptor from the lists above. DO NOT return vague phrases.

RISK LEVEL RULES:

LOW RISK DAYS:
- Always begin with: "Low flare risk —"
- Then choose ONE descriptor from THIS EXACT LIST ONLY - YOU MUST ROTATE THROUGH ALL OPTIONS, never repeat:
  * "steady pressure"
  * "stable pattern"

  * "gentle humidity"
  * "smooth conditions"
  * "easy-going pattern"
  * "soft, steady trend"
  * "low-impact day"
  * "calm weather pattern"
  * "settled weather"
  * "consistent pattern"
  * "steady trend"
- FORBIDDEN vague descriptors (DO NOT USE): "more stable", "at ease", "more balanced", "steady conditions", "gentle conditions", "balanced conditions", or any other phrases not in the approved list above
- CRITICAL: Even if multiple days are Low risk, each MUST have a DIFFERENT descriptor from the approved list. Never use the same descriptor twice in one week.

MODERATE RISK DAYS:
- Always begin with: "Moderate risk —"
- Then choose ONE descriptor from THIS EXACT LIST ONLY (vary across days):
  * "noticeable pressure shifts"
  * "light stiffness possible"
  * "mixed weather patterns"
  * "variable conditions ahead"
  * "pressure changes expected"
  * "shifting weather pattern"
  * "unsettled conditions"
  * "changing pressure trend"
  * "moderate weather shifts"
  * "transitional conditions"
  * "pressure fluctuations"
  * "weather pattern shifts"
- FORBIDDEN vague descriptors (DO NOT USE): "slightly effortful", "mild body sensitivity", "more activating", "less predictable", "mild discomfort", "a bit achy", "bit achy", "achy", "slightly uncomfortable", or any vague/medical-sounding phrases not in the approved list above

HIGH RISK DAYS:
- Always begin with: "High risk —"
- Then choose ONE descriptor from THIS EXACT LIST ONLY (vary across days):
  * "draining conditions"
  * "unstable pattern"
  * "heavier-feeling weather"
  * "high-variability pattern"
  * "challenging conditions"
  * "tense, activating shift"
  * "rapid pressure changes"
  * "significant weather shifts"
  * "unsettled weather pattern"
  * "major pressure fluctuations"
  * "storm front conditions"
  * "dramatic weather changes"
- FORBIDDEN vague descriptors (DO NOT USE): "stronger body sensitivity", "more demanding", "a bit achy", "bit achy", "achy", or any vague/medical-sounding phrases not in the approved list above

2. Vary selections so each day is unique - NEVER repeat the same descriptor in one week.
3. If multiple days have the same risk level, you MUST use different descriptors for each.
4. Rotate through all available descriptors before repeating any.
5. Even if all 7 days are "Low" risk, each must have a completely different descriptor from the approved list.
6. If you use a descriptor not in the approved list, the response will be rejected. Stick to the exact phrases provided.
7. FORBIDDEN vague phrases that will cause rejection: "a bit more", "a bit", "bit more", "more", "a bit easier", "a bit achy", "bit achy", "more stable", "at ease", "more balanced", "steady conditions", "gentle conditions", "balanced conditions", "supportive", "moody", "unusual", "relaxed", "relaxing", "may feel", "might notice", "may sense", "might experience", "could help", "may help", "might help".
8. If you cannot find an appropriate approved descriptor, use the closest match from the approved list - NEVER invent new phrases.

EXAMPLE OF GOOD VARIATION (all Low risk but different):
- Day 1: "Low flare risk — steady pressure"
- Day 2: "Low flare risk — stable pattern"  
- Day 3: "Low flare risk — predictable day"
- Day 4: "Low flare risk — cool, calm air"
- Day 5: "Low flare risk — gentle humidity"
- Day 6: "Low flare risk — smooth conditions"
- Day 7: "Low flare risk — easy-going pattern"

BAD EXAMPLE (repeating):
- Day 1: "Low flare risk — steady pressure"
- Day 2: "Low flare risk — steady pressure"  ❌ WRONG - REPEATED
- Day 3: "Low flare risk — stable pattern"
